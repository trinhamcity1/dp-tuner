# DP Epsilon Tuner

üöÄ A research framework for exploring the **privacy‚Äìutility tradeoff** in differential privacy.  
This project automatically **tunes the privacy budget (Œµ)** in synthetic data generators (DP-TVAE, DP-CTGAN) and finds the **smallest Œµ** that preserves downstream utility.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Auto-tuner for Œµ**: searches over DP noise multipliers (œÉ) and uses a privacy accountant to compute Œµ.  
- **Synthetic data generators**: supports DP-TVAE and DP-CTGAN (with DP-SGD).  
- **Utility evaluation**: trains downstream classifiers on synthetic data and evaluates AUROC on real test sets.  
- **Privacy probes**: optional membership-inference risk checks.  
- **Compliance-ready**: results can be mapped to HIPAA de-identification and regulatory reporting.

## üìä Research Problem
Hospitals and AI centers struggle to select a **differential privacy budget (Œµ)** when training models with private patient data.  
- Too small Œµ ‚Üí strong privacy but poor utility.  
- Too large Œµ ‚Üí weak privacy but good accuracy.  

This project addresses that by **automatically finding Œµ***:
\[
\min \epsilon \quad \text{s.t. utility (AUROC)} \geq \tau
\]
